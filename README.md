# FungiPhylogen 🧬🍄‍🟫🍄
FungiPhyloGen (FPG) is a production-grade bioinformatics pipeline designed for genomic epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of fungal pathogens (specifically Candida auris, C. parapsilosis, and Cryptococcus species).

Built on Nextflow, it leverages Conda for reproducibility and supports both local and HPC (Slurm) execution via profiles.
